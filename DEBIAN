To get debian packages going, you can run:

  aptitude install `cat ~/.emacs.d/debian-pkgs`

To save the ones you've got:

  aptitude search ~demacs | awk '$1 ~ /i$/ {if ($2 == "A") {print $3} else {print $2}}' > ~/.emacs.d/debian-pkgs.tmp

  for i in "\\-el$" "elisp" "emacs" "auctex"
  do 
    aptitude search ~n$i | awk '$1 ~ /i/ {if ($2 == "A") {print $3} else {print $2}}' >> ~/.emacs.d/debian-pkgs.tmp
  done

  cat ~/.emacs.d/debian-pkgs.tmp | sort -uk1 >> ~/.emacs.d/debian-pkgs
  
  rm ~/.emacs.d/debian-pkgs.tmp 

This tries to find all the installed packages that have to do with
emacs and save them to the debian-pkgs file in a format that dpkg
--set-selections will be able to read.
